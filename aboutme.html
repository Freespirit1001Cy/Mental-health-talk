      <div class="c1">
      <p>
      My name is Chimi Yangchen, a high school student from Bhutan enthusiastic to help, support and expand
      the mental health awareness community.
      I believe mental health is as important as physical health sice it forms a major part of our wellness.
      With the change in condition of the world and normalizing living with covid situation, it has become more
      important than ever to take care of our mental health.
        <br>
      In my country Bhutan, talking about mental health is still a major awkard thing to do. Therefore, breaking this glass celing and making mental health
      talk a normal talk is it motive behind this website.
